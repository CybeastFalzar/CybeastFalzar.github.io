Hi welcome to my website as you can see my name is Videsh Narine and I attend Queens College as a CS Major. 
I interned at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center this past summer which sparked a new found interest in 
data science Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at CUNY Tech Prep. I am expected to graduate in Spring 2023 
so I am on a job hunt as most seniors are. 

### My Interests

* C# game development in Unity3D
* Basketball 
* Volleyball
* DIY Construction 
* Playing Fire Emblem 
* Learning about tech in all aspects especially prosthetics 

### Favorite Classes at QC

Here are some classes that stood out in my time at QC so far.

* CS331 Database Systems with Peter Heller gave me a solid foundation in T-SQL and Relational Databases
* CS340 Operating Systems with John Svadlenka showed me low-level programming in C and how it relates to the abstraction higher-level languages     have today
* CS320 Theory of Computation with Bojana Obrenic highlighted how programming languages are context-free grammars with their own different rules to follow and emphasised that crtiical thinking is the greatest tool for programmers.
* * CS381 Applied Data Science with Jonathan Gryak gave me a strong background with Machine Learning models for both classification and regression as well as the math behind how these models actually work which lead an even greater understanding. Furthermore, I learned how to look at a dataset, ask questions and perform my own analysis based on the results of my ML models.
Thanks!
